## MAJOR TODO
- [x] backend startup without crashes
- [x] Fix bot commands not starting up (refreshing commands & loading commands)
- [x] Fix add vbucks command causing a full on server crash (Error executing command: vbucks - TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'profile.stats.attributes.gifts.push'))
- [ ] Fix duplicate commands error
- [ ] Fix postgress "unknown table" (idk if its my brain not braining or the backend doing something wrong tbh)
